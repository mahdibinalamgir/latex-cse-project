\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation behind this research is the use of technology, such as drones, satellites, sensors,AI and data analytics, to gather real-time information about various aspects of agricultural operations. This includes monitoring crop health, soil moisture,pH,temperature, nutrient levels  weather patterns, pest infestations, and irrigation needs. By automating these processes, farmers can make more informed decisions, optimize resource usage, increase yields,adjust their fertilization  and ultimately improve the efficiency and sustainability of their operations.
\subsection{The objectives of agricultural monitoring}
 \begin{itemize}
     \item\textbf{Enhancing productivity:}Utilizing technology, sustainable practices,
and education to optimize agricultural output and resilience.
\item \textbf{Mitigating risks:}Implementing diverse crop portfolios, insurance schemes,
and climate-smart practices to mitigate agricultural risks.
\item \textbf{Detecting pests and diseases:}The process of identifying and monitoring the presence and spread of harmful organisms and illnesses
affecting crops or livestock within agricultural systems.

\item \textbf{End hunger:}Ending hunger in agriculture requires implementing sustainable and equitable food systems, increasing access to nutritious
food, and addressing root causes of poverty and inequality.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Possible outcomes}
Enhancing productivity: One of the methods of soil quality assessment is using sensors and AI. Sensors are devices that can measure 
various soil parameters, such as moisture, pH, temperature, nutrient levels, organic matter, salinity, etc. AI is 
a branch of computer science that can analyse the data collected by the sensors, and provide insights, 
predictions, and recommendations for the farmers.
\subsubsection{Sensors and AI:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{Soil moisture sensors:}  These measure the water content in the soil, helping farmers avoid overwatering, optimize irrigation use, and ensure crops receive the right amount of moisture. They can be 
placed at different depths for deeper insights.
\item\textbf{pH sensors:} These measure the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, crucial for knowing which nutrients are 
readily available to plants and adjusting fertilization accordingly. Improper pH can hinder nutrient uptake 
and harm crops.
\item\textbf{Temperature sensors:} Soil temperature is vital for various factors, including microbial 
activity, nutrient availability, and seed germination. Monitoring temperature helps farmers understand 
these processes and predict potential issues.
\item\textbf{Nutrient sensors:}  Advanced sensors can directly measure specific nutrients like 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. This provides real-time data on deficiencies and allows 
for targeted fertilization, reducing waste and environmental impact.

\section{Argument}
\subsection{Inferiority in Farming}
"Inferiority in farming" refers to the condition where certain farming practices, technologies, or agricultural systems are deemed to be less effective, efficient, or productive compared to alternative methods. This can result from various factors such as outdated techniques, inadequate resources, environmental constraints, or lack of access to modern agricultural inputs and technologies. Inferiority in farming can hinder farmers' ability to optimize their yields, reduce costs, and adapt to changing market demands, ultimately impacting their livelihoods and the sustainability of agricultural production.
